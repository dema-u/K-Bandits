### K-Armed Bandit problem

Practice using the strategy design pattern to solve k-armed bandit problem in various ways.

The K-Armed Bandit can be modelled as a stationary as well as a non stationary problem, which are both supported in this
repo in the `k_armed_bandit.py` 'context'.

3 'strategies' are implemented to solve the problem namely upper confidence band, gradient method and the e-greedy
method.
